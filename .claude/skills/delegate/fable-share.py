"""fable-share.py — post-run metering and attribution for a delegated run.

The delegate skill's section 2a ("Metering and attribution") makes the metered figure the
close-out truth: lane-reported numbers are estimates. This script produces that figure from
the harness transcripts, reporting three head quantities and every lane's usage:

  - output — the head session's output tokens over the run's turns (the quantity the
    fable-minimising objective targets);
  - flow   — input + cache creation + cache read + output, the whole token flow;
  - peak   — the largest single call's context (input + cache creation + cache read).

Method (section 2a, transcript form): parse JSON records, never substring greps; dedupe
assistant records by message id keeping the FINAL usage record per id, because a step's
earlier records carry a placeholder output count; sum the four usage fields per model. The
model and effort mixes are counted over the same de-duplicated calls, so both sum to the
call count.

It then prices that usage. After the unchanged `fable share:` line it prints

    billed (list, prices <date>): head $X · lanes $Y · session $Z · rewrites k ($w) ·
    tool uses/call head <a> lanes <b> · delegation <single|multi> (<head|owner>)|unstated ·
    baseline <label|none> ·
    lanes n (reasons: (a)×i (b)×j (c)×k (d)×l, none×m) · metered n of m recorded

and one line per model carrying that model's token quantities beside its dollars. The
quantities are printed beside the dollars, never replaced by them: list prices are a proxy
for the plan accounting the owner is actually billed under, which is opaque, so the tokens
are the durable measurement and the dollars are the comparison aid. `--per-agent` adds one
row per agent (the head and every lane): label, model(s), calls, first-call prefix, peak
context, output, tool uses and list dollars.

Billing definitions, each with its derivation:

  - list dollars — per de-duplicated call: input, cache read, 5-minute cache write, 1-hour
    cache write and output tokens, each at its family's rate from `prices.json` beside this
    script (the one price home; its own header carries the rates, their source and the
    substring matching rule). Cache tiers come from `usage.cache_creation`'s two
    `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` / `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens` fields; a record carrying no
    such sub-object falls back to `cache_creation_input_tokens` counted at the 5-minute
    rate, and the number of records that fell back is printed on the control line, since
    the fallback is a guess about a tier and must be visible.
  - rewrite — a non-first call of an agent whose cache write is at least 0.9 x BOTH that
    agent's previous call's context and its own (input + cache read + cache write, each). The
    class it names is the full-context rewrite: a model or effort switch, or an expired cache
    entry, rewrites the whole context at the write rate instead of reading it, so the call
    writes back what the previous call held AND reads next to none of its own context. The
    own-context half is what separates a rewrite from a long turn that reads its prefix from
    the cache and appends a large tool result: without it — the rule shipped until 2026-09-05,
    which tested the previous context alone — 37 of the 174 calls flagged in a sweep of one
    harness projects directory (444 transcripts, 13,148 calls, 2026-09-05) had read most of
    their own context back rather than rewriting it (written fraction 0.48 to 0.90), while the
    same rule's `previous_context and` guard silently dropped 43 true rewrites, every one of
    them following a call whose usage record carried four zeros. The 0.9 itself is set by
    judgement: in that sweep 98% of the 12,565 non-first calls wrote under half their own
    context and 129 wrote essentially all of it, but the tail between is continuous (nearest
    calls either side of the line: 0.8995 and 0.9009), so the tenth of slack is a choice about
    how much of a turn's own growth to absorb, not a gap the data draws. No token floor is
    applied: the smallest write the rule flagged in that sweep was 45,318 tokens, so the
    20,000-token floor of the head-side probe that opened the question would have cut nothing.
    `rewrites k ($w)` counts those calls and prices their cache writes alone (the part of the
    call the rewrite added).
  - tool uses per call — distinct `tool_use` content blocks divided by de-duplicated calls,
    per agent kind (head, lanes). Counting is by block id across every record of a message,
    because the harness writes one transcript line per content block and the final record
    carries only its own block; block ids are distinct, so no block is counted twice. The
    ratio matches the harness's own per-lane `tool_uses` figure where a spawn record holds
    one (checked against one lane of run 2026-09-04: 22 of 22).
  - reason tally — the letters (a) to (d) read out of each `lane-open` event's `reason`
    field in the run's spawn record (`--spawn-record`). A reason may name more than one
    letter, and each letter it names is counted, so the tally can exceed the lane count; a
    lane whose reason names none is counted under `none`. Without a spawn record the tally
    and the recorded-lane count both read `n/a`.

Lane discovery by id (`--spawn-record <path>`): an in-session lane is matched by its
`agent_id` to `<project-dir>/<session>/subagents/<agent-id>.jsonl` — the session of its own
partition, which is the metered one unless the paragraph below says otherwise — a headless lane by its
`session_id` to `<projects-root>/*/<session-id>.jsonl` — any project directory under
`--projects-root`, never a guessed one. Record-resolved lanes are metered alongside whatever
`--lanes` finds, de-duplicated by content identity as usual, and `metered n of m recorded`
states how many `lane-open` events were matched to a metered transcript. A mismatch is a
flag on the line, not a premise failure: the figures printed are still real, and the exit
code stays 0, because an unmetered lane understates the bill rather than corrupting it.

A run outlives one head session, so the record is partitioned before any of that is counted.
`run-open` and `run-resume` each name the session that wrote the events after it; every lane
event belongs to the partition its most recent marker opened, and metering one session
expects that session's partition alone — `metered n of m recorded under run-resume <first
eight characters of the session id>` names which. Lanes of another partition are neither
expected nor called missing, a metered transcript recorded under one of them is reported as
from another session of this run rather than as unrecorded, and the reason tally covers the
metered partition only. A record with no marker at all is one partition and it is this
session's, the shape every record had before markers were read. A marker that named no
session claims nothing: its partition is counted on the mismatch flag, never guessed at.

A lane can run under two heads: opened under one and resumed under another through the
wrapper's `lane-resumed` event (the same lane name and session id, a second `lane-closed`
after it). Such a lane belongs to each partition it ran under, and its usage records are
split at the resume's timestamp: the opener bills the records before it, the resumer those
from it on, so each head's line carries the lane cost its own partition incurred and the run
total stays the sum over the heads. The split is by timestamp rather than by the wrapper's
recorded per-close cost because every figure on the billed line is metered from a transcript
and priced from the dated table, while a recorded cost is the harness's own figure on its own
basis; a lanes figure summing the two would be a sum of unlike quantities. `metered n of m`
counts, for the metered partition, the lanes that ran under it (opened or resumed there), and
the reason tally counts each of them. A lane that ran under one session only is metered as it
always was, by the head's window alone. A shared lane whose open or resume carries no
parseable timestamp cannot be split and is left unmetered for every session, flagged on the
line as unsplittable, since a guessed boundary would bill one head for the other's work.

Read-only by construction: it opens files for reading, prints to stdout, and creates,
moves or deletes nothing anywhere. Diagnostics go to stderr.

Premise discipline: a figure is only ever printed when the probe demonstrably ran. Any
broken premise prints, exactly,

    fable share: unmetered (<reason>)

and exits 2 — in text and JSON mode alike, so a consumer checks the exit code before
parsing. Broken premises: the project directory or the session transcript is missing or
unreadable; a marker does not match; the window holds no assistant record; the window is
inverted; lane scanning finds no readable transcript at all; lane discovery finds a number
of lanes other than --expect-lanes; a flag cannot yield a meaningful figure (a negative
baseline, an expectation that cannot be checked); a spawn record that is missing, unreadable
or holds no lane event. An unforeseen error is reported the same way, with its traceback on
stderr, so a crash can never masquerade as a metered run.

Billing has the same discipline, one step later and with its own line. When the metering
succeeded but the pricing premise fails, the `fable share:` line still prints (it needs no
prices) and the billed line is replaced, exactly, by

    billed: unbilled (<reason>)

with exit 2, in text and JSON mode alike — never a zero, never a partial payload. Broken
billing premises: `prices.json` missing, unreadable or not JSON; a table missing a field,
carrying a non-numeric or non-positive rate; every model id matching no price family (one stray
id beside a priced family is priced-with-an-unpriced-list instead, 2026-09-04); the
known-positive control failing. That control runs on every invocation before any billed
figure is printed: the script prices one built-in fixture call (1,000,000 input, 400,000
cache read, 200,000 5-minute write, 100,000 1-hour write, 50,000 output tokens on a Fable
id) and asserts the table returns $17.10 — 10.00 + 0.10 + 2.50 + 2.00 + 2.50, hand-computed
against the rates the shipped table carries at its date. The anchor is keyed to that date:
when the table is re-priced and its `prices_date` moves, the anchor no longer binds and the
control degrades to its table invariants (every family present and positively priced, the
fixture priced above zero and strictly increasing in each of the five quantities), saying so
on the control line rather than failing a legitimate re-pricing or passing silently.

A malformed record never crashes the run and is never guessed at: a record whose message is
not an object, whose id is unusable, or whose usage carries a non-numeric value is counted
and reported rather than summed. A transcript torn by a write in progress reports its
unparseable line count, saying so when the final line is the torn one.

One threshold classifies and none decides: the 0.9 of the rewrite definition above labels a
call, changes no figure and blocks nothing, and it is stated with its derivation where it is
defined. Every other number printed is measured from a transcript or priced from the dated
table; the presentation constants are the single decimal place on the share percentage, the
two on dollars and tool uses per call. Every default the script chooses (project directory,
temporary root, lane mode, window bounds, matching fallbacks, price table, delegation
source) is printed in the header or on the control line, so a wrong derivation is visible.

Usage (from anywhere; nothing is assumed about the working directory):

  python3 fable-share.py --session <id> [--vault <root>] [--project-dir <path>]
      [--start <iso|marker>] [--end <iso|marker>] [--lanes auto|none|<glob>...]
      [--expect-lanes <n>] [--baseline-output <n>] [--tmp-root <path>]
      [--format text|json] [--per-agent] [--spawn-record <path>]
      [--projects-root <path>] [--delegation single|multi --delegation-src head|owner]
      [--state-dir <path>] [--baseline <label>] [--prices <path>]

  --project-dir defaults to the harness's mapping of the vault's absolute path: every
  character outside A-Za-z0-9- becomes a hyphen, under ~/.claude/projects/. The mapping was
  checked against every project directory of a harness home, comparing each transcript's own
  cwd field with the directory holding it (6 of 6 matched, one path containing an @). Paths
  carrying spaces or non-ASCII characters were not among them, and a decomposed accent maps
  to two hyphens where a composed one maps to one, so a mismatch is possible there: when the
  derived directory or the session file inside it is missing, the failure names the sibling
  directory that does hold the session, and --project-dir overrides the derivation.
  --start and --end each take either an ISO timestamp or a text marker; a marker is
  matched against user-message text for --start (the invoking prompt) and assistant-message
  text for --end (the close-out reply), falling back to any record type and saying so. A
  marker matching more than once takes the first match and reports the others.
  --lanes auto searches both known homes for in-session lane transcripts, the durable
  <project-dir>/<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl and the volatile
  <tmp-root>/claude-*/<project-basename>/<session>/tasks/*.output (observed 2026-09-02),
  de-duplicated by content identity: the volatile entries are frequently symlinks to the
  durable files, and some are not transcripts at all. --lanes none meters the head alone and
  asserts no share. Scanning that reaches no readable transcript is a broken premise, since
  a zero lane total would otherwise be a claim with no control behind it; --expect-lanes 0
  is how a run with genuinely no lanes asserts that on purpose.
  --spawn-record adds discovery by id from a run's spawn record (see above) and turns on the
  reason tally and the recorded-lane count; --projects-root (default ~/.claude/projects) is
  where a headless lane's own session file is looked for, across every project directory
  under it. --per-agent adds the per-agent table to text output; the JSON payload always
  carries the same rows under per_agent, so a consumer never needs the flag.
  --delegation with --delegation-src records which delegation regime the run used and who
  chose it. Without the flags the regime is read from the head session's state file,
  <state-dir>/<session>.json as role-style-anchor.py keeps it (its `delegation` and
  `delegation_src` keys, when the regime is single or multi: the head's resolution under
  `auto`, or the owner's word), so the meter runs BEFORE the run's `set-delegation clear`;
  then from the `- **delegation**:` line of <vault>/CUSTOMISATION.md (the pre-rename
  `- **mode**:` line as a fallback) with source `owner`; then `unstated`. --state-dir
  defaults to ~/.cache/aimyth/role-style. --baseline is free text naming what this run is
  being compared against, `none` by default. All are printed and never interpreted: they
  exist so two runs are only ever compared on the same work, and the billed line's
  `(head|owner)` says whose choice the regime was. --prices overrides the price table path,
  whose default is prices.json in this script's own directory.

    A run outlives one head session: `run-open` and `run-resume` each name the session that
    wrote the events after it, so every lane event belongs to the partition its most recent
    such marker opened. Metering one session therefore expects that session's partition and
    no other, which is what keeps a resumed run from reporting an earlier session's lanes as
    missing. A `lane-resumed` event (the wrapper resuming a lane, the same name and session
    id) adds a span to the lane it names — the lane then belongs to the resume's partition
    too, from the resume's timestamp on — so a lane resumed by a later head is billed to that
    head for the resume and to its opener for the first run. Returns (lanes, unparseable,
    partitions, has_markers, unopened_resumes): each lane carries the index of the partition
    that opened it and its `spans` (partition and timestamp of the open and of every resume,
    in record order); a partition whose marker named no session carries None, never a guess;
    a resume naming a lane the record never opened is counted, never invented. A record with
    no marker at all is one partition, matched against whatever session is being metered —
    the shape every record had before run markers were read.
