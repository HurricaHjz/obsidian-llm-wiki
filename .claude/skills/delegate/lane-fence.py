"""lane-fence.py — the lane-side PreToolUse(Bash) fence for a headless thin lane.

`--restricted` confines the FILE tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit) to the working
directory plus the `--add-dir` grants, and removes Bash unless `--tools` names it. It does
not fence the shell channel: a lane holding Bash can `cat` anything the user can read. This
hook is that missing fence. It is installed only in the lane home's own settings file, which
the wrapper passes with `--settings`, and must never be installed into the vault's settings —
it denies far more than a head session should ever have denied.

It keys on PATHS taken from the spawn environment, never on an agent key: an in-session
PreToolUse event carries `agent_type`, a headless one does not (probed 2026-09-04), so the
vault's own `deny-lane-shell-writes.sh` cannot serve a headless lane. The two variables are
written by the wrapper at spawn:

    LLM_WIKI_LANE_GRANTS   os.pathsep-joined absolute directories the lane may READ
    LLM_WIKI_LANE_WRITES   os.pathsep-joined absolute directories the lane may WRITE (may be empty)

Implicitly granted for reads and writes, whatever the variables say: /tmp (and its resolved
form) and /dev — not $TMPDIR. Lane scratch is sanctioned, and a benign /tmp
write was the only shell-write incident the vault has recorded (2026-08-27). Implicitly
granted for reads only: the lane home (the working directory) and executables that already
exist under the system bin directories, so a lane may invoke /usr/bin/grep without the fence
reading that path as data access.

What it denies, in this order, so the reason names the real cause:
  1. an invocation of `claude` (a lane may not spawn lanes, nor escape its own fence);
  2. a write channel — redirection, tee, `sed -i` / `perl -i`, or a mutating command word
     (mv, cp, rm, mkdir, rmdir, touch, ln, install, truncate, dd, chmod, chown) — whose
     target is outside the write set, or ANY such channel when the write set is empty
     (temporary roots and /dev excepted). A mutator is judged on ITS OWN segment and on its
     target arguments alone (`mutator_targets`): a compound line's other commands are not its
     targets, and for cp/mv/install/ln the sources are reads, tested by checks 3 and 4. That
     segment and its words are read QUOTE-AWARE (`shell_segments`, N10), so a separator inside a
     quoted argument starts no segment and a mutator word inside another command's quoted prose
     is prose; and an operand that names no file — a chmod mode, a chown or chgrp owner spec, a
     flag's value, a redirection target — is dropped by the SHAPE of the token, never by a list
     of known values, so `chmod 644 644` still reads its second operand as the file it writes;
  3. a relative path token that escapes the working directory (a `..` component);
  4. an absolute path token outside the read grants.

Before any of those four run, the HEREDOC BODIES are removed (`strip_heredocs`, design D33):
`<<` and `<<-`, quoted (`'EOF'`, `"EOF"`) and bare terminators, several heredocs opened on one
command line consumed in marker order, a line equal to the terminator (after `<<-` strips leading
tabs) ending that body there, and an unterminated body running to the end of the text — each as
the shell reads it, so what the fence calls data is what the shell calls data. The command line
carrying the `<<` STAYS: its own redirect targets and command words are checked as before, and a
`>` on that line still denies when its target is outside the write set. A `<<` inside quotes, and
anything after an unquoted `#`, opens no heredoc, so neither can hide a command from the checks.
Checks 3 and 4 — the read side — take their path tokens from `read_tokens`, which reads a quoted
string in this order (`quoted_kind`, D33 as amended by critic C2, N1): content holding a newline or
an OPERATOR character (`|`, `;`, `&`, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, a backtick, `^`, a backslash) is payload —
a pattern, a pipeline, a script; content starting with `/`, `~` or `$` is ONE path however many
spaces it holds, tested whole with any glob part cut (`"/x/*.md"` → `/x/`), so a spaced path is
checked rather than split into words that each pass; a `/`-led string in the slash-delimited
PATTERN shape carrying a metacharacter no path or glob has (`'/^## Open/'`, `'/x/{print $2}'`) or
in the address-range shape (`'/a/,/b/p'`) is payload, not a path (N9, `slash_pattern`); any other
whitespace-bearing content is prose and is payload; a bare word is a token like any other. A
`$`-led quoted string takes whatever is GLUED to it as part of the same token (`"$V"/wiki`), the
spelling `"$V/wiki"` and the bare `$V/wiki` both already having passed (N9c). Check 1 keeps the
whole (heredoc-stripped) text and its quoted content, so `python3 -c "... claude ..."` still
denies. Check 2 runs on the QUOTED-STRIPPED text (N9): a `>` inside quotes is not a redirection in
any shell, and scanning it as one denied three live command lines that wrote nothing. A quoted
single-path target survives the strip as a target (`> "/x/y"`), so on the WRITE side (N3, measured
by C2) a redirection, `tee` or mutator target whose text carries `$` or a backtick is still denied
outright: the fence cannot expand it, and a variable joined to the working directory passed every
other test for a head whose cwd sat inside its W.

`--head` (or LLM_WIKI_FENCE_ROLE=head) is the HEAD role, used by .claude/hooks/head-fence.py
(design D34), which imports this module and calls `check()` rather than spawning it (N8): check 1
is off (a head spawns lanes) and a CLEARED command is answered with SILENCE — exit 0, no stdout —
never an explicit `allow`, which the harness reads as auto-approval and which, armed in an attended
session, would bypass every shell prompt the owner still wants (the same rule handsoff-gate.py's
docstring states). `git` gets no rule of its own in either role: it is not a mutator token, so
nothing denies it, and its paths are checked like any other command's. A deny is the same JSON deny
in both roles, and the grants and writes come from the same two variables.

Premise cases, each made to behave rather than to guess:
  - stdin is not JSON, or carries no `tool_input.command` for a Bash call → DENY
    (`lane-fence: hook input unreadable` / `no command in hook input`). Fail-closed: a fence
    that cannot see the command cannot clear it.
  - LLM_WIKI_LANE_GRANTS absent, empty, or all-whitespace → DENY every Bash command
    (`lane-fence: no grants in environment`). This is the case that fires when the hook is
    reached from a session the wrapper did not start, which is exactly when it should.
  - `tool_name` is not Bash → no output, exit 0 (the harness decides). The settings matcher
    already scopes the hook to Bash; this is the belt.
  - an empty or whitespace-only command → allowed with no output: it writes nothing and
    reads nothing.
  - LLM_WIKI_LANE_WRITES absent or empty → a read-only lane: every write channel outside the
    temporary roots denies. Absent is not "unfenced", it is "no writes".
The process exits 0 in every case; a non-zero exit from a PreToolUse hook is a harness error,
not a denial, so it is never used to express one.

A cleared command gets an explicit `allow` decision rather than silence IN THE LANE ROLE. Silence
leaves the command to the ordinary permission flow, and a lane spawned with `--permission-prompts
none` has every would-be prompt turned into a denial, so silence would fence the shell to nothing.
The explicit allow is therefore what makes a granted `cat` run, and it makes this hook the
sole arbiter of the lane's shell — which is why its deny rules are conservative. In the head role
the opposite holds and a cleared command is silent (see `--head` above): the head's session keeps
its ordinary prompts, and an allow there would switch them off.

Every reason begins `lane-fence:` so the wrapper can count fence denials in the lane
transcript apart from the harness's own tool denials.

Residual false-deny class, narrowed by D33 and N9 and stated in what it still is (a retry tax, not
a hole). On the READ side a quoted string is payload or path by its content, so `grep 'see
/etc/hosts' f` is allowed, and a `/`-led PATTERN is payload wherever it carries a regex
metacharacter or is an address range; a pattern made only of letters and slashes (`'/foo/'`,
`'/foo/p'`) carries neither and is therefore still read as a path, so it false-denies outside the
grants — write it with an anchor, a class or a range (`'/^foo/'`, `'/a/,/b/'`) and it is payload.
A quoted glob (`"/x/*.md"`) is a path token, and `* ? [ ]` are for that reason not pattern
metacharacters: reading them as pattern markers would clear `cat "/etc/*"`. What that costs is
the other way round and is accepted: a two-segment path whose file name carries a brace, a bar or
a plus (`"/etc/{a}"`) is read as a pattern and passes unchecked, a file name no vault holds. On
the READ side a LITERAL quoted directory glued to a name (`cat "/x"/y`) is still split into two
tokens, so the tail (`/y`) is tested as a path of its own and false-denies; N9c glues only a
`$`-led string, and the write side reads the same word whole (N10, measured 2026-09-06).
Fail-closed residues that stay: a mutator whose
target is a variable (`chmod +x "$f"`, `cp a "$D/b"`) is denied, because the fence sees no literal
path to test — a lane writes the literal path; an interpreter's program argument (`sh -c '…'`,
`python3 -c '…'`) keeps its content for the read checks, so a path inside it is tested and an
outside one denies as before D33, while a program passed with no `-c`/`-e` flag (an awk or sed
script) is payload the fence cannot decide; `sh -c '...'` still hides its payload from the
command-word tests; a relative symlink pointing out of the grants is not resolved. Each of these
fails towards denial; a lane that hits one reports the gap and the head re-spawns it with the grant
(the re-spawn rule), which is the designed recovery. The one direction that is NOT fail-closed is
named, and it is a READ: a quoted target whose variable the fence cannot expand — `cat
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/x"`, `cat "$D/secret"` — is one path token that is not absolute,
so checks 3 and 4 have nothing to test and it passes. Unquoted it always passed too (`tokens_of`
splits on `$`), and the WRITE side of the same shape denies outright (N3), so what remains is a
lane reading through a variable it set itself; the grants, not this fence, are what bound that.
