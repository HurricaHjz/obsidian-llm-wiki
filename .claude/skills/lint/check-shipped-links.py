"""check-shipped-links.py — shipped-surface wikilink guard (CLAUDE.md §11 / §12).

Question it answers: does any Markdown file that ships with the public framework carry a [[wikilink]]
that resolves in THIS vault but not in the published copy? Such a link is dead for every installer. It
does not judge links that are dead everywhere (typos, renamed pages): shipped skills use placeholders
such as [[topic]] on purpose, so those are counted on the control line, never flagged.

Surfaces (keyed on the export's own auto-discovery contract, its list_skills / list_agents functions):
every *.md under .claude/skills/ and .claude/agents/, minus vault-shaped content bundled inside a skill
(any path with a wiki/ or raw/ segment below .claude/skills/, i.e. the shipped seed demo, which ships as
vault content and resolves among itself). Root docs (CLAUDE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md) are out of scope:
their [[…]] are naming examples by design, and §12's ship-safe-citation rule governs their citations.
Generator output (what setup.sh writes into a fresh vault) is the installed vault's content, not a
shipped surface.

Names that ship, and are therefore never findings: `index` and `log` (setup.sh creates wiki/index.md and
wiki/log.md in every install) and every page of a bundled example tree (.claude/skills/**/example/**/*.md,
installed by `setup.sh --with-example`).

Links: fenced blocks, inline code spans and HTML comments are not links (the strip_noise rule of
check-links.py); targets resolve the way Obsidian does (alias/heading stripped, a table-escaped pipe's
trailing backslash dropped, path-style by last segment, an explicit .md dropped, case-insensitive),
against page basenames AND frontmatter `aliases:` — an alias resolves here and dies in the published copy
just the same. Known limitation, shared with check-links.py: only three-backtick fences are recognised
(no ~~~, no four-backtick nesting); zero such fences in any shipped surface at the time of writing.

Call sites — one implementation, two callers, so they cannot drift:
  lint SKILL.md Step 2g (routine, edit time) · the publish gate's test suite, leg 14 (publish).
Regression fixtures: test_check_shipped_links.sh beside this file (run with bash).

Usage: python3 check-shipped-links.py [VAULT_ROOT]      (default: three levels above this file)
Prints ONE summary line for the lint report, then one "  <file> → [[target]]" line per finding:
  shipped-links: clean (control OK: N surfaces, M wikilinks seen, P wiki pages + aliases = Q names,
                        S shipping names excluded, U targets resolving nowhere here, self-control fired)
  shipped-links: n/a (wiki/ present but empty — no vault-only page can be linked)
  shipped-links: K dead in the published copy (control OK: …)
  shipped-links: PROBE FAILED — <reason>
Exit 0 clean or n/a · 1 findings · 2 PROBE FAILED. Premise failures never read as clean: no wiki/
directory (wrong root) → 2; no shipped surfaces → 2; an unreadable or undecodable surface → 2; the
matcher's self-control (a synthetic surface linking a synthetic page must be caught) silent → 2. An EMPTY
wiki/ is legitimate absence (a fresh install, the published copy itself) → n/a, exit 0.
