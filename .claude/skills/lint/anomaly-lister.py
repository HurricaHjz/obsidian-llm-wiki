"""anomaly-lister.py — the page-visible anomaly census a verify leg checks a report against.

A compile lane's report ends with an Anomalies section. Verifying it by hand means
re-reading every page the lane touched; this script instead lists what the PAGES
themselves say, so the verify leg is a comparison rather than a re-read.

Four kinds, all read straight off the page
  open-conflict  a Conflicts / Open Questions block (CLAUDE.md 4.4) whose text carries
                 no settled marker. An empty block records nothing, so it counts as an
                 empty block rather than an open one.
  flagged        a `flagged:` frontmatter line (the query/output staleness flag), with
                 its text, so the reason travels with the count.
  thin-page      prose saying the page rests on too little — single witness, single-source
                 stub, uncorroborated.
  unverified     inline `unverified` markers (CLAUDE.md 11), counted per page.

What is stripped before matching: fenced code blocks and HTML comments, neither of which
is page-visible prose. Inline code spans are KEPT, because the inline marker is habitually
written inside backticks and stripping spans would silently zero the commonest kind.

Counting the marker, two ways (`--unverified-form`, printed in the header)
  any        every occurrence of the word in visible prose. The default, and the honest
             census: it is a floor on nothing and a ceiling on nothing.
  backtick   only occurrences inside an inline code span, i.e. the MARKER form CLAUDE.md
             prescribes. Prose that discusses the marker rather than applying it — a
             design page explaining when to write it — drops out, so a verify leg that
             must compare like with like has a form to ask for.

Self-control (CLAUDE.md 11): every run analyses one synthetic page held in memory that
carries all four kinds (the marker in both forms, so the control vouches for whichever
`--unverified-form` is active) plus one empty conflict block, and prints
`anomaly-control: 4/4 … empty-conflict control: 1/1`. A miss prints PROBE FAILED and
exits 2 — an analyser that cannot find a planted anomaly cannot report a page clean.

A broken premise prints one plain `PROBE FAILED: …` line on stdout and exits 2 whatever
`--format` says, so a JSON consumer keys on the exit code, never on parsing that line.

Stdout only: this script never creates, modifies, moves or deletes a file.

Usage:
  python3 anomaly-lister.py [--vault ROOT] [--format text|json]
  python3 anomaly-lister.py --pages PATH [PATH ...] [--format text|json]
  optional: --settled-markers 'a|b|c'   --thin-regex 'x|y'   --unverified-form any|backtick
  exit 0 = the probe ran (findings or none) · exit 2 = broken premise
