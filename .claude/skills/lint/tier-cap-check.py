"""tier-cap-check.py — the mechanical half of confidence verification (CLAUDE.md 4.6).

The rubric has a judgement half (is this source really authoritative?) that only a
reader can settle, and a mechanical half that a script settles better than a lane:
the type cap and the two boundaries. This script owns the mechanical half.

Rules applied
  (a) type cap    concept, entity, tool, model, benchmark, synthesis and development
                  cap at `high`; `map` omits confidence entirely; `source` and `user`
                  may reach `authoritative`. Any value outside the five tiers is invalid.
  (b) boundary 1  a `source` page whose every raw entry sits under the social lane, or
                  whose source URL points at a social platform, CAPS at `low`. A page
                  below that cap is not a finding: the rubric's tie rule is to pick the
                  lower tier, so a social capture at `very-low` is obeying it.
  (c) boundary 2  a compiled page citing exactly ONE source document is at most `high`.
                  That equals the type cap, so it is reported as the boundary it is: a
                  proposed `authoritative` on such a page fails on both grounds, and the
                  note is what lets a report name the second one.

Documented overrides (the line 4.6 ends on: an explicit user instruction overrides a tier)
  A page records that instruction in the inline comment on its own `confidence:` line.
  A comment carrying the word "override" moves that page's tier findings out of
  `violations:` and under `overrides (documented):`, with the page and the comment
  excerpt, so a mechanical check tells a recorded judgement from a slip — the same tier
  with no comment stays a violation. Only the three JUDGEMENT rules are overridable:
  they are about how high a tier sits. A `map` carrying confidence, and a value outside
  the five tiers, stay violations whatever the comment says — they are schema breaches,
  with no trust judgement for an instruction to override. An override comment that
  suppresses nothing is reported as an `override-unused` note (usually a judgement whose
  page has since changed).

Two input modes
  --vault ROOT        check every wiki page's own frontmatter (the audit pass).
  --verdicts FILE     check a lane's PROPOSED tiers: a JSON array of
                      {"page": <path>, "tier": <tier>} objects, each optionally carrying
                      its own "comment" (where the proposal records its own override).
                      Each page's type and sources still come from its frontmatter on
                      disk, so a proposal is checked against the real page, never against
                      itself.

Self-control (CLAUDE.md 11): every run builds synthetic records in memory and re-runs the
same rule functions over them — one violating record per rule (`cap-control: 3/3`), one
record per zero-able note family and one documented/undocumented override pair
(`extra-control: notes 2/2 · overrides 2/2`). A miss prints PROBE FAILED and exits 2,
because a rule engine that cannot catch a planted violation cannot report a clean vault.

A broken premise prints one plain `PROBE FAILED: …` line on stdout and exits 2 whatever
`--format` says, so a JSON consumer keys on the exit code, never on parsing that line.

Stdout only: this script never creates, modifies, moves or deletes a file.

Usage:
  python3 tier-cap-check.py [--vault ROOT] [--format text|json]
  python3 tier-cap-check.py --verdicts proposed.json [--vault ROOT] [--format text|json]
  exit 0 = the probe ran (findings or none) · exit 2 = broken premise
