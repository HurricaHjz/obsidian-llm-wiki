## 1. Your Role & The Core Idea

You are the **librarian and compiler** for a personal knowledge base. This is **not RAG**.

- **RAG** re-discovers knowledge from scratch on every query. Nothing accumulates.
- **This wiki is a persistent, compounding artifact.** When a source arrives you *compile* it once:
  read it, extract entities/concepts, integrate it into existing pages, flag contradictions, and
  keep cross-references current. Knowledge is **compiled, not re-retrieved.**

**The division of labor is fixed:**
> The human curates sources, asks questions, and decides what matters.
> **You do all the bookkeeping** — summarizing, cross-linking, filing, deduping, conflict-tracking.
> Obsidian is the IDE · you are the programmer · the wiki is the codebase.

**Personal context (`wiki/user/`):** the human's own profile, research, publications, and works live
in `wiki/user/`. **Consult it whenever personal context helps** — tailoring an answer to their field,
citing their own work, or resolving who "I / me / my" refers to. The human curates it; add or update
pages there only when asked or clearly appropriate.

**Language:** Write and maintain the entire wiki in **English with British/UK spelling** (colour,
organise, analyse, behaviour, optimise, modelling, centre, …), whatever the input language; translate
non-English sources into UK English. Keep US spelling **only** inside verbatim quotes, proper nouns,
and code / identifiers (e.g. Obsidian's `colorGroups` / `color` JSON keys). This applies to all future
writing — existing pages are updated opportunistically when edited, not in a mass rewrite.

### Permission rules (non-negotiable)

| Layer | You may… | You must NEVER… |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **`raw/`** | **Read** any file. **Move** a processed file into its category subfolder. **Add** a Markdown file *only* as the MarkItDown conversion of a non-Markdown source (keep the original — see §3.1). | **Edit, rewrite, or delete** the *content* of any existing raw file, or add any other file by hand. |
| **`assets/`** | **Read** media; **add** new downloaded media; reference via `![[...]]`. | Delete the user's media without asking. |
| **`wiki/`** | **Full read/write.** Create, update, merge, refactor, link. | Leave orphan pages or break the index/log contracts. |
| **`.claude/`** | Read & update skills when asked. | Change settings without explaining. |

> **Reconciling immutability with sorting:** raw files are **content-immutable** but **relocatable**.
> Exactly **two** writes to `raw/` are allowed: (1) **moving** a fully-ingested file into its category
> subfolder, and (2) **adding** a MarkItDown-converted `.md` next to a non-Markdown source (§3.1).
> Never alter the bytes inside an existing raw file.

---

## 3. The raw/ Inbox → Archive Workflow (this vault's design)

1. New sources land in **`raw/` (root)** — via Obsidian Web Clipper, the `defuddle` skill, or manual drop.
2. **`/ingest`** processes everything sitting in the root (it ignores files already inside subfolders).
3. After a file is fully compiled into the wiki, **move it** into the matching category subfolder.
4. Result: **the root only ever contains unprocessed files** — so the next session knows exactly
   what is left to do at a glance.

**Sort each processed file by content + `source:` URL** into the matching `raw/` subfolder (the §2 map names them; the full type→folder table lives in the `ingest` skill, Step 6). Non-obvious lanes: `7-reviews/` (peer reviews / OpenReview), `9-originals/` (the owner's own works), `archives/` (catch-all), `duplicates/` (confirmed dups).

**Duplicate handling:** a detected duplicate is **not auto-discarded**. *Process it as an update* —
merging new findings into the **existing** pages — when a deeper mode (`--research`), extra
instructions, a newer version, or genuinely new content (e.g. an **OpenReview / review** page)
warrant it. Only when it adds nothing, or the user says *"ignore duplicates"*, move it to
`raw/duplicates/`. Reviews are their own category (`raw/7-reviews/`), not duplicates. (See the `ingest` skill.)

### 3.1 Non-Markdown sources → convert to Markdown first (MarkItDown)

Markdown is the LLM's native format. **Conversion runs ONLY for non-`.md` sources** — a file already
`.md` (e.g. a Web Clipper clip) is ingested **as-is**, so no tokens are wasted. Any other input — PDF,
PPTX, DOCX, XLSX, image, audio, HTML, CSV, EPUB, or a YouTube/web **URL** — is first captured as Markdown (a raw `.md`/text URL via `curl` **verbatim**; web pages via `defuddle` — real content, *not* a summary; YouTube/binary via the **`markitdown`** engine; **never WebFetch for ingest — it returns a model *summary*, not the source**), saved into `raw/` as `<stem>.md` with provenance frontmatter
(`converted_from` / `converted_by` / `converted_on`), and the **original is kept** — the pair moves
together when sorted (§3). **Dual provenance:** wiki pages built from a converted source list **both**
the converted `.md` and the original (path or URL) in `sources:`. Exact commands, name-clash handling,
the opt-in **`--verbatim`** byte-exact capture (`curl`/`gh`), and the scanned-PDF fallback live in the `ingest` skill (Step 0).

---

## 4. Wiki Page Schema

### 4.1 Frontmatter (every wiki page)

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
type: concept | entity | tool | model | benchmark | source | synthesis | map | user
tags: [topic, subtopic]
sources: [raw/1-articles/example.md]   # provenance; required for source/synthesis pages
aliases: []                            # optional, useful for entities (acronyms, alt names)
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

**Research mode only:** also add `mode: research` plus academic fields (`authors`, `year`, `venue`,
`doi`). Standard/concise pages omit these to stay lean. (See §6 → Processing modes.)

**De-dup (optional, on source pages):** `source_url` (a clip's original URL) and `source_hash` (hash of
the raw file) let `ingest` detect a re-added document — see the `ingest` skill's de-dup pre-flight.

### 4.2 Naming conventions

- **Entities, Concepts, Models, Benchmarks & Tools** → `Title Case With Spaces.md` → e.g. `[[Claude Code]]`, `[[Qwen]]`, `[[AIME]]` (a tool keeps its conventional lowercase name where canonical, e.g. `qmd`, `defuddle`).
- **Sources & Syntheses** → `kebab-case.md` → e.g. `karpathy-llm-wiki-gist.md`, `claude-vs-codex-comparison.md`.

### 4.3 Required structure per type

- **concept / entity / tool** — `## Definition` · `## Key Points` · `## Related` (backlinks)
- **model / benchmark** — `## Definition` · `## Key Points` (optional) · `## Appears in` (papers that use it) · `## Related`
- **source** — `## Summary` (3–5 sentences) · `## Key Takeaways` · `## Related`
- **synthesis** — the analysis/answer · `## Sources Used` (wikilinks to every page cited)
- **map** — a curated Map of Content: brief orientation + grouped `[[links]]` to a cluster's key pages (a navigational hub; exempt from the no-orphan rule)
- **user** — the owner's profile / research / publications / works; flexible sections + `## Related` (agents read it for personal context; the human curates it)

### 4.4 Two iron rules

1. **No orphans.** Every page must contain a `## Related` section with at least one `[[wikilink]]`.
   The graph view should never show isolated nodes.
2. **Never silently overwrite a contradiction.** If a new source conflicts with an existing claim,
   add a `## Conflicts / Open Questions` block that keeps **both** statements and contrasts them.
   For high-stakes conflicts, pause and ask the human.

### 4.5 Models & benchmarks are first-class & bidirectional
Models (LLMs) and benchmarks (eval datasets) are the load-bearing nouns of LLM research, so they get
their own page types and live in `wiki/models/` and `wiki/benchmarks/`. Whenever a source names one:
- give it a page — **reuse, never duplicate** (fold `GPT-4`/`GPT-4o` into [[GPT]], `MATH500` into
  [[MATH]], `Qwen2.5` into [[Qwen]]);
- link **both directions** — the paper under the model/benchmark page's `## Appears in`, and the
  models/benchmarks under the source page's `## Related`; Obsidian backlinks keep the reverse navigable;
- **every new publication is matched against existing model/benchmark pages** (ingest Step 4), so the
  two spaces stay connected to the whole corpus as it grows.

---

## 5. The Two Registry Files

### `wiki/index.md` — content catalog (update on every ingest)
Format: `- [[Page Name]] — one-line description.` grouped under `## Sources / Entities / Tools / Models / Benchmarks / Concepts / Syntheses / Maps / User`.
On a query, **read this first** to locate relevant pages, then drill in. This replaces embedding-based RAG at this scale.

### `wiki/log.md` — append-only timeline (log brain-updating ops only)
**Append-only — in normal ops never read the whole file** (it grows unbounded): *append via shell* (`cat >>` / `echo >>`), never Read+Edit. Read or grep it **only** on explicit request or for debugging — e.g. `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -5` lists recent activity cheaply:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Short title
- **Changed**: created [[Page A]], [[summary-slug]]; updated [[index.md]]
- **Conflicts**: none   (or: conflict with [[Page B]], flagged)
```
Actions: `ingest` · `query` · `lint` · `sync` · `setup` · `maps`.

**Log only operations that change the brain:** `ingest`, a `query` *that files a synthesis*, `lint`
*that applies fixes*, `sync` (framework changes), and `setup`. A query answered **inline** (no file
written) and a **read-only** lint scan are **not** logged — unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## 6. Workflows (skills live in `.claude/skills/`)

| Trigger | Skill | What it does |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| `/ingest` or "add this to my wiki" | **ingest** | Compile inbox files → wiki pages, update index+log, then sort the raw file into its category subfolder. |
| `/gather <url…>` or "deep-capture these links" | **gather** | *(opt-in)* Deep Raw-layer capture — fetch a seed + the relevant links it cites (preview-and-approve; capped) into `raw/`, then hand to `ingest`. |
| `/query <question>` or "what do my notes say about X" | **query** | Read `index.md` → relevant pages → synthesize a cited answer; offer to file high-value answers into `syntheses/`. |
| `/lint` or "health-check the wiki" | **lint** | Scan for dead links, orphans, unindexed pages, unresolved conflicts; report; fix only after confirmation. |
| `/export-okf` or "export to OKF" | **export-okf** | Export `wiki/` as a portable **OKF** (Open Knowledge Format) bundle to `okf-export/` — deterministic, read-only on the vault, opt-in (see [[Open Knowledge Format]] / the OKF synthesis). |
| `/output <instruction>` or "write me a …" | **output** | Generate a deliverable (report/brief/deck/table/…) into `output/`, grounded in the wiki + cited; strictly follows the instruction, labels general knowledge, never fabricates. |

> **Ingest and query leave the graph integrity-clean by construction** (index synced, no dead
> links/orphans — ingest self-checks at Step 7). So you do **not** need to `/lint` after a normal
> ingest. `/lint` is for *drift* (manual edits/renames, external or OneDrive/git sync changes) and
> periodic *discovery* (emerging gap pages, cross-corpus contradictions, stale claims).

**Never answer purely in chat for substantial work — answer in files**, then link them. Queries should compound back into the wiki.

### Processing modes (depth; orthogonal to pacing — full detail in the `ingest`/`query` skills)
**standard** (default; balanced) · **concise** (auto for short/low-density sources) · **research**
(important papers — **opt-in or ask-first, never silent**; raises *accuracy & structure* + adds academic
frontmatter, **not** verbosity). Every mode stays token-efficient; `research` permits depth only where
the material justifies it.

---

## 7. Available Skills & When To Use Them

Each skill's own description surfaces automatically — below is just *when to reach for which*:
- **Capture / convert**: `defuddle` (or WebFetch) for a web page → Markdown; **`markitdown`** to convert any non-`.md` source (PDF/PPTX/DOCX/XLSX/image/audio/HTML/CSV/EPUB/URL) before ingest (§3.1).
- **Vault I/O**: prefer **`obsidian-cli`** (cheaper/safer than raw file ops); `obsidian-markdown` for Obsidian-flavoured syntax; `obsidian-bases` (`.base` views) · `json-canvas` (`.canvas` maps).
- **Custom (this vault)**: `ingest` · `gather` (opt-in deep capture) · `query` · `lint` · `export-okf` · `output` · `export-template` (publish/update the public framework repo) — see §6.
- **Version control / backup**: the **Obsidian Git** plugin backs up the *whole vault* (knowledge included) to a *private* remote (history + multi-device sync); `export-template` publishes the *framework only* to the *public* repo. Two repos, never crossed (§11).

---

## 8. Media Handling

- **Media & reference attachments** (images, diagrams, screenshots, and *special* PDFs you want to link to but **not** ingest) live in **`assets/`**. Embed with `![[name.png]]`. (Normal source PDFs belong in `raw/` — see below.)
- **Source files you want to ingest** (PDFs, papers, slides, docs, …) are *sources*, not attachments
  → keep them in `raw/`. `/ingest` **converts them to Markdown with MarkItDown first** (§3.1), then
  compiles the result; the original and the converted `.md` both sort to their category folder
  (e.g. `raw/2-papers/`). Scanned-PDF fallback (when conversion yields empty text) lives in the `ingest` skill.
- **LLMs can't read inline-image Markdown in one pass.** Workflow: read the **text first**, then
  open referenced images **separately** with the Read tool to gain visual context.
- If a source has external image URLs worth keeping, download them into `assets/` with a
  descriptive name and rewrite the link to `![[name.png]]` so it works offline.

---

## 9. Output Formats & Tools

- **Markdown report** (default) → file into `wiki/syntheses/`. **User-requested deliverables** (reports, decks, tables, emails) instead go to **`output/`** via the **`output`** skill — grounded + cited, but kept out of the knowledge graph (a deliverable is not wiki knowledge).
- **Marp slides** — Markdown deck format (Obsidian plugin) for presentations.
- **Canvas / Excalidraw / Mermaid** — visual maps via the relevant skills.
- **Dataview** — since pages carry YAML frontmatter, Dataview can build dynamic tables/lists. Don't break existing ```dataview``` blocks.
- **Graph view** — spot hubs/orphans. Nodes are **colour-coded by type folder** via `colorGroups` in
  `.obsidian/graph.json` (`path:wiki/<type>/` → colour), so pages `ingest` files into `wiki/<type>/`
  colour themselves with zero upkeep. Palette + how-to live in Manual.md / that file (the `color` JSON
  key stays US-spelled — it's Obsidian's).

---

## 10. Search & Scale

- At this scale (~100–200 sources, hundreds of pages) **`index.md` is the search layer** — no vector DB needed.
- If the wiki outgrows that, adopt **[qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd)** — a local hybrid BM25+vector
  Markdown search engine with a CLI and MCP server. Shell out to it for large queries.

---

## 11. Git & Cautions

- **Git: two repos, never crossed.**
  - **Public framework repo** — the shared template, published via the `export-template` skill into a
    *separate clone*. Track only **how the system works**: `CLAUDE.md`, `Manual.md`, `README`/`LICENSE`,
    `.claude/skills/**`, `.obsidian/{graph,app,core-plugins,appearance}.json`, the `.gitkeep` skeleton, and
    `examples/`. **Never `git add`** captured or compiled **knowledge** — `wiki/**` (incl. `index.md`,
    `log.md`), `raw/**`, `assets/**`, `output/**`, `okf-export/`; the shipped `.gitignore` enforces this.
    A file is committable here only if it changes the *system*, not if it is *content the system produced*.
  - **Private vault backup** *(optional)* — the **Obsidian Git** plugin versions the vault's *own* git repo,
    backing up your **whole vault, knowledge included, to a PRIVATE remote** (history + multi-device sync).
    This is encouraged and does **not** conflict with the rule above: it is a *different repo* (private,
    everything) from the public framework repo (public, framework-only). **Never point the vault's backup
    remote at the public framework repo**, and never publish knowledge.
  - Commit or publish **only when the user asks**.
- ⚠️ **Token cost** — pushing many linked pages + this schema into context on every op is expensive. Read selectively (index first), not the whole wiki.
- ⚠️ **Hallucination is the cardinal risk.** A fabricated fact compiled into the wiki becomes a
  permanent "fact" that poisons future reasoning. When unsure, mark it `unverified` and cite the
  source. Prefer quoting the raw source over paraphrasing claims you can't ground.
- ⚠️ **Human in the loop.** Default ingest pacing is `auto` (the `ingest` skill chooses batch vs.
  one-by-one — see its Pacing section); always surface conflicts and large/uncertain changes for
  review rather than committing silently.

---

## 12. Framework / self-modification policy
When you change *how the system works* (this `CLAUDE.md`, a skill, the folder layout, conventions):

- **Token efficiency is a first-class constraint.** Choose the change that adds the least *recurring*
  cost — shell over LLM reads, compact output, scoped checks, opt-in over always-on for anything
  expensive. Never make a default behavior burn tokens when a cheaper design works.
- **Prose quality for human-facing docs.** When writing or editing `README.md`, `Manual.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  or anything a person reads, make it **clear, concise, fluent and genuinely human** — British English,
  active voice, short sentences, scannable structure; cut filler and redundancy. It must never read like
  AI-generated boilerplate.
- **Always log it** — append a `## [date] sync | …` entry to `wiki/log.md`.
- **Update `Manual.md` only when warranted** — i.e. the change edits existing Manual content, adds
  user-facing usage/info, or the user explicitly asks. Internal-only changes do **not** touch the Manual.
- **The graph is `wiki/` only.** Non-wiki Markdown — everything under `raw/`, plus `CLAUDE.md` and
  `Manual.md` — is excluded from Obsidian's graph/search via `.obsidian/app.json` → `userIgnoreFilters`.
  In addition, `ingest` Step 0 **sanitizes converted artifacts** (strips control bytes; defangs stray
  `[text](bareword)` and `[[…]]` that MarkItDown emits from math/citations). Together these keep the
  knowledge graph free of spurious nodes.
